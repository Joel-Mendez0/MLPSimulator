# Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) Project
This project implements a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network with support for multiple hidden layers and output neurons. The neural network is trained using the backpropagation algorithm. The code includes functions for network initialization, forward pass, backward pass, training, and evaluation.

# Only change the middle indices corresponding to the number of neurons in the hidden layers. Can add as many layers as you like
EXAMPLE: layer_sizes = [4, 4, 32, 3]
